# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

 Hello there and welcome to my site! My name is Quinten Lambert, and I love to program. Recently I have
 taken interest in video game programming, and I have begun to work in Unity. This site will serve as a 
 compilation of my personal work so feel free to browse at your leisure! If you have any questions or if 
 you would just like to chat, I can always be reached by my email: lambertquinten@gmail.com
