Hello there! My name is Quinten Lambert, and I am currently an undergraduate student studying Computer and Information Science at Berea College. I have had a great time getting to know the people around me and learn about a craft that I knew nothing about as I started my undergraduate work in 2013. I have now been able to make something out of my love of technology and entertainment outlets, which has lead me to my new found love of computer programming. 

Starting off not knowing a thing about programming 3 years ago, I have now learned how to code in 9 different languages, with my favorite language being C. With these skills I have learned, and my innate love for the entertainment industry, I have decided that I want to pursue a career in video game development as a programmer. In order to make this dream a reality, I have started to work on my own personal game development projects using the Unity Engine, these projects can be found linked on my projects page. 

My hobbies include shooting pool, programming, playing video games, making video games, and electronics.

If you would like to know more about me, or have questions about my projects, then feel free to contact me via email at: lambertquinten@gmail.com
