## [](#header-2)Introduction
For one of my first projects to get my feet wet in the process of game development I have decided to remake one my favorite mini-games. The card game in Final Fantasy 8, Triple Triad, has kept my attention for far longer than the actual game has. In other words, I have spent more time trading cards than I have following the main story of the game. 

Since I knew a lot about the game from my experiences playing it, I decided to attempt a complete recreation of it from the ground up. To achieve this goal I decided to use the Unity game creation engine, even though I had minimal experience with programs of its type. 

## [](#header-2)What is Triple Triad? 
If you are curious about the game that is Triple Triad, I will point you to the [Final Fantasy Wiki Page](http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Triple_Triad)

I have made the game in its basic form and as of now it does not have any of the special rules defined in the aforementioned linked page. 

## [](#header-2)My Motivation
In my recent years learning Computer programming at Berea College, I have often puzzled about what I wanted to do with my life after having learned these skills. After some research and reflection I decided to make something out of my love of video games. I am currently hoping to become a video game programmer in the years to come, but until that day comes I will be doing personal projects to increase my skill level in the field.

Controls are as simple as click and dragging a card to a location on the game board. Score is shown in the upper corners of the screen and the winner is decided by who has the higher score when the gameboard is filled. 

Blue player goes first every time. 

At the moment I have a partially built game that does all of the basic functions of the original game itself. However, I must apologize for state that it is in considering playability. All known issues at the moment:

1. There is no title screen
2. There are no on screen pop ups to let the players know who's turn it is or when the game is over
3. There is no way to close the game screen once it has been opened

As for that final point, the only way to close the game on windows is to either close it through task manager, press ALT + F4 while in the game screen, or to ALT + TAB out of the game to close it manually by right clicking the icon on the task bar. Again I apologize for this inconvenience, these three problems will be addressed in the next update of the game.
