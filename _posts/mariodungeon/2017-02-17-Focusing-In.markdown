## [](#header-2)Focusing on what is Important

I mentioned a couple weeks ago that I have been tackling the creation of a menu system in three parts. Throughout these
couple of weeks, I have made no forward progress in creating an end product for the menu. I initially attempted to create 
an inventory for the player, however, it has quikly become appararent that I have been researching this process completely 
wrong. The GUI system included with Unity is hard to learn and even harder to master. The attempts that I have put into
understanding this system for the creation of the menu has lead to very small victories throughout the process. The problem
lies in the fact that I do not have a working product yet, and many of the games mechanics rely on the inventory in order to
function as we intend it to. I am stuck trying to get something to work, and it is disheartening to put a lot of time into a 
single feature, only to have it fail time and time again. 

## [](#header-2)What I have been Doing

In order to tackle this problem I have been attempting to follow tutorials on the Unity GUI system to learn about its plethora
of features and following others code on similar projects. First, the tutorials on the GUI are extremely helpful in learning
specific functionalities of the GUI system. This comes at the downside of not understanding how to implement each piece as part
of a functional whole. This is where I turned to the similar projects to see how others coded their inventory systems. I am currently
exploring these projects for any helpful code that I can find and understand how to use. Hopefully, I will be able to complete a
working inventory by the end of next week.
