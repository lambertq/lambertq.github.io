## [](#header-2)More Information as promised!

These past few meetings with my peers have been wonderful experiences when it comes to the ideas that they have and 
how they portray them. Working with these two is going to be a wonderful experience. That aside I would like to share
some more information on Mario's Dungeon as we have come up with it. 

## [](#header-2)Initial Concept

As I have stated before, Mario's Dungeon will be a thriller game based in a single dungeon. The player will be taking
control of a single playable character that will find their way to this dungeon for whatever reason (the actual reason
for the player character being here is still being worked out). Inside, the player will be faced with a multitude of
dark rooms and corridors that are littered with traps, puzzles, and crazy twists. Push, jump, climb, sneak, and run
your way through the dungeon to discover the dark secret that lies within. 

## [](#header-2)Gameplay Mechanics

Unfortunately I won't be able to release much more story about the game concept as we don't completely know everything
ourselves. However, we have made some design decisions. 

1.  We will be working to create a top down two-dimensional game that will look very similar to 
[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_to_the_Past). This style
of game will allow us to spend less time worrying about the graphics, and allow us to spend more time perfecting the mechanics
of the game in our limited working time. 

2.  The aforementioned puzzles will be handcrafted by us in the game itself. I do not know how much the other two
will make use of outside inspriation for this, but I plan to pull some puzzle ideas from one of my favorite games 
[Golden Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Sun).

3.  Finally, thanks to Bianca, we have a better idea of what we would like the dungeon to look like! The concept art shown below was scetched out during our most recent meeting and we all agreed that the design just fit what we were expecting to a point. The design itself is still not complete, but this is definately a good start.
