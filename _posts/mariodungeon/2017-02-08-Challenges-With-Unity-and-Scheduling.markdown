## [](#header-2)My Struggle to Make an Inventory System

I have hit my first roadblock with this project with the creation of a working inventory system. After attempting to create one on my own,
of which I was unsuccessful, I have spent countless hours (when I could) following tutorials. This has also proven to be unsuccessful, 
however, I have found snippets of code that could make my attempt to create my own inventory system from scratch. Unfortunately I do not 
have much to report back from this week due to this hardship, but I hope to have something by this weekend. 

## [](#header-2)College Student Struggles

Somehow I thought it would be a good idea to take two research based classes this semester on top of this team initiated study. All of my
free time has been spent reading books and preparing my research for both classes. Initially both classes had vastly different subjects, but
after talking to both of my professors, I have found a subject that is a compromise of both class topics. Now that I have similar research
topics in both class I should have a lot more time to spend on this project.
