## [](#header-2) A Note from Me to You

Here is a little note that I wrote up for my team initiated study that I wanted to share. These are my thoughts on trying
to make a game from scratch in a semester.

---

  It is over. This two-year dream to create a class of my own has come and gone. Two peers and I have attempted to create a game from
  nothing during this semester, and, looking at how far we have gotten, I am proud of what I can take away from this course. This delve 
  into game design taught me many things throughout the process, especially since I was able to get the experience of working in a team 
  environment throughout the semester. Working with Austin and Bianca has had its benefits and issues; nevertheless, I have enjoyed 
  working with them. In the beginning of the semester, I thought that we would be able to finish a game over the course of approximately 
  15 weeks. I was wrong. I have experienced the woes of Game Design in the real world, and it is daunting. 
	
  I was overzealous in the beginning. I wanted to create a design document in two weeks, and then completely implement that design over 
  the next 13. I quickly began to realize what I had gotten myself into, and it all started with us not finishing the game design document 
  on time. Was it because of our lack of communication? Did we make our project too big? There were many questions going through my head 
  when we were unable to turn in a finished document. However, it was towards the end of this process that the answer came to me: Time. 
  To be honest, giving ourselves only two weeks to flesh out a new idea was out of our scope, we needed at least half of the semester to 
  make sure the design was to our liking. Even so, we stopped designing and began to implement. I quickly found my first problem with this 
  process.
	
  Since we did not determine a complete system for the HUD or the inventory system, we started to have many misinterpretations about each 
  of our expectations for the project. Our team was falling apart from the inside. We were able to fix it, but, in hindsight, I see that
  we fixed it too late. I was personally struggling trying to get a working inventory system and pause menu to work. My school and 
  personal lives were constantly lording over me, demanding constant attention. As time went on, I spent less time actually coding 
  on the project, and more time researching how to approach these issues. I was spending excessive amounts of time trying to get 
  something so seemingly simple to work. It was starting to wear me down. 

  I eventually hit rock bottom, my family had some major issues, and I was failing one of my classes; I had no drive to do anything. 
  After some hard decisions were made, I redoubled my efforts and tackled the project again. Success started happening, and it is 
  addicting. With my vigor restored, I continued tackling problems with our code and eventually we got to where we are now. 

  All of this is to say, I have learned more than how to code a video game. The process has become painfully easy to see through my 
  hindsight. By changing up how we approached the game we could have possibly achieved more throughout the semester. When working with 
  a team in this environment, communication is key. Use trello, slack, and any other messaging system you can get your hands on. These 
  tools are invaluable to any team working on the same project that cannot be together all the time. We are students first, and with 
  that comes a plethora of responsibilities that stack on top of this project. Time is of the essence. Teams, especially small teams
  like ours, need to fully understand their scope of the project, and set a hierarchy of tasks to be completed. We built our team to
  be specialized on certain tasks instead of working together on a lot of materials. I see now that this was a large cause in our 
  team’s disconnect. I feel that we could have done better by being more straightforward with our level of skill in unity and our 
  comfort levels with programming in unity. 

  Finally, I want to express my thoughts on the structure of the class if it were to ever be offered again. This class is an expansion 
  of CSC 186: Game Design in my mind. Giving the class an entire semester to produce a game design document is crucial to understanding 
  all of the essentials before tackling a large semester-long project. Each project should be completed in a team of no more than four
  but no less than two. I stress this concept, as almost all game design programs in the real world are team based; students need to 
  understand the importance of communication with their team. I found this out too late, and did not make the best use of our trello 
  board or our slack channel. As a final note, I believe that projects should be scaled down to be worked on one feature at a time. 
  The importance of having a specialty in the game design world cannot be overlooked. Many teams will hire a person for their 
  specialty, not their overall knowledge of game design. If a student wants to focus their entire semester on making an AI program, 
  then they should be allowed to do that. The focus of this class should be shifted from having a final working game, to the creation 
  of a few well-designed features that these students could implement in their future projects. The process is the key, and in order 
  for this class to be a success, the students need to fully understand and utilize the process of game design; while not forgetting 
  about the all-too-important skill of time management. 

  I recognize my faults, and accept them. One must fail in order to learn, after all. If I had anything to take away from this 
  experience, it is that game design is stressful, but highly rewarding if you persevere through the stress. Large projects will 
  take time, but each individual piece of the project has a weight and it up to each designer to determine which features have more 
  weight than others do. Be prepared to change your design constantly, and always have alternative methods close by; not everything 
  will go as planned. Finally, my final bit of knowledge is to enjoy what you do. If you do not enjoy struggling with one feature, 
  try another. Explore many different paths to find the one for you. I found mine, and it only took two semesters of game projects, 
  two conferences with amazing speakers, and many tears. Always remember to stay strong and keep trying, you will get there. 
  Jesse Schell has never said it better: “YOU are a game designer”.
