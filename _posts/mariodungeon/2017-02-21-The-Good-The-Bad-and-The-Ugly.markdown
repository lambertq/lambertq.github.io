## [](#header-2)The Good

Process has been made on the project, but unfortunately that is not where the good news lies this week. Austin has
found a way to get source control working on our project! We have created a bitbucket repository for our work and 
we have been slowly beginning to implement it so that we can all work in our own respective branches! Now that we
can document our progress, it has already become easier to help each other out when someone has issues with their code.
This has been a great step forward for all of us, and I hope that we continue to use this religiously thorughout the
remainder of the semester! 

## [](#header-2)The Bad

It is quite unfortunate that I was finally able to get the menu system working on my own personal project a couple days ago.
We recently created a new master file for the project and posted it on a bitbucket repository so that we could all work off the 
same project file but in different branches. I figured it would be just fine to implement my newly created inventory system, 
complete with drag and drop functionality, into the new master file. I have never been more wrong. I am unsure as to why code 
from one project absolutely refuses to run in another, but attempting to copy the script files completely tanks the functionality
that I have put in place. I will need to explore this further and find a fix before too long. I just want to move on already, this
menu is killing me. 

## [](#header-2)The Ugly

With source control and breaking code balancing out my week nicely something else had to sneak its way in to cause some well needed 
chaos. My personal life has flared up again, family problems and falling behind in schoolwork. I have been unable to put as much time
as I might want on this project, but I am sure that I'll be able to do something about these issues soon. In order to bring about some
stability to my life this semester, I am considering dropping a course. However, I need to know more about my situation before making
that decision. I have scheduled meetings with my advisor and the professor of that course to evaluate my progress.
