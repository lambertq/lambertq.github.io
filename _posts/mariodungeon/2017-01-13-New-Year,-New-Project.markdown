## [](#header-2)Introducing the Mario's Dungeon Project

* * *

Finally a two year dream has come true! Two of my peers and I will be participating in a team initiated study in advanced game development
during my final semester of my undergraduate work. There are no words to describe how excited I am to dive right into this material and get a
working product out by the end of the semester. My teammates are Bianca Marrero and Austin McGlothlin, and together we will be creating
a terror game in the Unity engine.

The project, called Mario's Dungeon (named after the professor of our team initiated study, and the chair of the Computer Science department at
Berea College, Mario Nakazawa), will be a top down exploration game based in the terror genre. Most of this information has come from two
recent meetings that I have attended. The first of these two was with the group itself (Bianca, Austin, and I) where we discussed what we
wanted out of this semester, which game ideas and features we would like to work on, etc. I personally thought this meeting was great and
that everyone got a bit of what they wanted in the project. The second meeting was with our professor, Mario Nakazawa. This meeting was 
focused on the story aspects of the game, and led to a lot of good brainstorming. However, I feel like we should have spent more time 
discussing more of the expectations that Mario wanted out of us this semester. This can be alleviated in next week's meeting, so I am not 
worried about it too much. 

I am worried about one thing though. I have worked on a project in Unity in the past, but only alone. Starting to work on the same project
as two other people, raises a few version control issues. One of which I am unsure of how to approach effectively. Should there be a single
master copy of the game that houses everyone's work in one spot, or should each of us have a full version of the game locally stored on our
machines. I have brought up the idea to my peers, and it seems that the consensus is that we will use GitHub, however, I am not fully convinvinced 
that GitHub will be optimal for our needs. I am willing to try it out and see how it works, but storing Unity code on GitHub has caused issues
for at least Austin the past. With a project that will need a tight handle of version control, I am just worried that something is going to
go wrong with the use of GitHub.

That aside, I am extremely excited to be working with Austin and Bianca this semester, and I have the utmost confidence that we will be able
to produce something that we can all be proud of.
