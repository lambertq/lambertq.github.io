## [](#header-2)Bringing the Design Phase to an End

Austin, Bianca, and I have been hard at work bringing the design phase of this project to a close. During this week we have been
transitioning to programming key mechanics for the game. Austin has provided a basic walking script for the game, while Bianca is
working on creating a stamina bar so we can limit the amount of time that the player can utilize the sprinting function of the game.
I am currently working on menu concepts and putting together a menu screen that will consist of a working inventory system, more on
that below.

In other news, we have the first working map in place for the dungeon and we are currently drawing out the rooms to scale on graph
paper before we convert it to a digital version. 

## [](#header-2)The Menu Screen

For this week I may have undertook a monster of a project, but it is necessary nevertheless. My goal is to have a working menu screen
that has 3 major components: a text box that lines the bottom portion of the screen, an eight slot inventory on the top right of the
screen that will serve as the player's backpack, and the top left of the screen will consist of a visual representation of the character
as well as a meter to depict their sanity level and a 3 slot quick inventory that they can access while traversing the dungeon. At this
moment I do not have enough impletmented to show off. I will provide pictures of my progress in my next post. 

There will also be more on the features that haven't been explained yet as they are being implemented (you can find these details on
one of the three project blogs as noted previously). 

## [](#header-2)Administrative Accomplishments

On top of this forwward progress, Austin, Bianca, and I have made strides as a team when it comes to management and organization. Since
last week we have created a trello board to divvy out tasks on a weekly basis and track how many of them get completed. We have also
created a solid schedule that will work as our "class" schedule. We have figured out who is meeting who at what times during the week.
This removes any confusion surrounding meeting times throughout the week and we are expected to show up to all of the meetings that we
signed up for. 

Overall, this project is in a wonderful place to begin production of key mechanics that will build the backbone of our game. This has
left me feeling good about all aspects of the project at this time.
