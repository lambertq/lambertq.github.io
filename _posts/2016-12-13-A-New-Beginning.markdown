## Portfolio is a go!
Finally, I have some resemblence of a website up and running to post my work to! Can I get a hurrah? No? Alright then. Anyway, as I have stated in the bottom right of the screen this website will serve as my portfolio and will showcase my work as a greenhorn game programmer. At this moment I am in the process of uploading information, downloads, and documentation for my most recent project: a remake of Final Fantasy's Triple Triad. 

## Moving forward
I have plans to continue small projects like Triple Triad into the future in an attempt to widen my skillset and understand how different types of games function. As with my previous project I will be using the Unity engine to create these small games, and I will be building each and every one of them from scratch. I am excited at the prospect of learning new approaches and overall attempting to understand how to create my favorite entertainment outlet.
